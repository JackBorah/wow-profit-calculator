Better tables found later in development that I didn't crafted_item
to change to using. 

SkillLineAbility includes the tradeskill category, recipe id, and spell id in a single table

ItemSparse contains info like vendor purchase and sell prices, max stack size, ...

ProfessionXRating seems to contain something like item modifiers for a profession 
stats like multicraft

SpellReagents table contains a recipes reagents (not modified crafting reagents)
and their counts and recraft counts

CraftingData:
    Table for some DragonFlight (or more expansions?) crafting items
    For example:
        Crafting Data id = 6 is for a shield of the hearth (192081) and shows this in CraftedItemID column
        Crafting Data id = 7 is for the different qualities frostfire alloy which is given in the CraftingDatItemQuality table which refers to this crafting data id

    Illusterious Insight (item=191529, spell=382381) doesn't have a crafting data record

SpellEffect:
    Table for all spells (recipes, combat, ...)

    For example:
        Illusterious Insight (item=191529, spell=382381) shows the item it produces under EffectItemType
        Draconic Vial (item=191474, spell=374477) has the item's this spell produces under EffectMiscValue[0] which refers to a CraftingDataID=246 for these vials

    Getting all recipe products from spell ids:
        All recipes have a spell id (see SkillLineAbility for recipe and spell ids)
        Some recipe spells show their products by crafting data in the EffectMiscValue[0] or item id in the EffectItemType column
        # not all item products come with a crafting data id

CraftingDataItemQuality:
    Table for items with different qualitites like draconic vials grouped by their shared crafting data ids.
    
    Bugs:
        CraftingDataID=1 has item ids which are missing from the items table


SpellReagents:
    Some recipe spells in 10.0.7 have different material needs vs the same spell in 10.1 this may reflect
    mats being removed in 10.1 or its a bug between those versions.

CraftingQuality:
    Ids : QualityTier
    1     1
    2     2
    3     3
    These first 3 qualities are the qualities for all trade goods. Like draconic vials 1,2,3

    The rest (ids: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are the ids for crafted weapons and gear and is used in their
    modifier lists but not in their item records.

Multicraft
Not sure if the data contains info on what is multicraftable or what those rates are.
Current theory:
It may be that items with a quantity > 1 are all multicraftable since in 
transmutations the transmutes that produce 2 quantity are multicraftable 
while the transmutes that produce 1 (spellEffects value=1 (wowhead) or effectbasepoints=1) 
is not multicraftable

ProfessionEffectType:
    Table of profession stats. See ProfessionEffect for the stats and amount of the stat.
    The EnumId is the id refrenced in other tables.

ProfessionEffect:
    Table of profession stats (from ProfessionEffectType table) and the amount 
    of that stat given.

    Ex: 
    Salad on the Side gives 90 multicraft. The record for this has EnumId 7 (multicraft)
    and amount of 90. The id for this record is then used in CraftingReagentEffect
    to connect it to the Salad on the Side Modified Crafting Category.

    MCR_slots?
    Some records have a MCR_slot id which all have the same ProfessionEffectTypeEnumID
    this is because those slots are unlocked by that enumid. This ties into the in game
    profession tree since you need to level up the profession tree to unlock these slots. 
    If you look at their ProfessionEffectTypeEnumID its "Unlock Reagent Slot"

CraftingReagentEffect:
    This table tells what crafting stats a ModifiedCraftingCategory gives via its
    ProfessionEffectId. Has a order column since a single ModifiedCraftingCategory
    can have multiple ProfessionEffectId.

    Ex:
        Writhefire Oil increases difficulty and chance to skill up so its 
        ModifiedCraftingCategory 127 has two different ProfessionEffectId's linked to it.

    Ooey Goey Chocolate Increases the amount of item from multicraft. May need special
    consideration since this is only done with this item while all other increased
    multicraft output is from traits.
    Shimmering Embroidery thread is similar to the choclate but for resourcefulness.
    This one has its savings increased by 25% and 25 is given by its ProfessionEffectID
